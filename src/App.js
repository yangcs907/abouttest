From rolling dumplings with her grandmother for her famous chicken and dumplings, stirring gumbo with her aunt while preparing for the crawfish boil, grilling clams and shucking corn at her grandparentsâ€™ house. Without realizing it, she was falling in love with the food and the memories it has the power to create. In 2018, Amelia was named one of the Top 10 Best New Chefs in America by Food & Wine magazine
